                <p class="description">Hi there! I'm Anne Martijn Schots, also known as Martijn. I'm currently studying
                    HBO-ICT at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam with a focus on Game Development. I've worked on several
                    school projects and even a game jam to further develop my game developing skills.</p>
                <p class="description">I got a passion for making unique experieces to entertain an audience. I love
                    working in Unity, Unreal Engine or any other gaming Engine that works with 3D. I also got 4+ years
                    of experience working in 3D software, Blender to be specific, so it's save to say that I may know a
                    thing or two when it comes to 3D related aspects of game creation.</p>
                <p class="description">I also got a degree and experiece as an "application and media development", or
                    more widely known as a software developer. I'm pretty much ready for anything you throw at me, and I
                    am eager to learn about new topics and methods to further improve my skill as a softrware developer!
                </p>
