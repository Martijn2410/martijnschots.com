            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p class="description">Abyssal Surge is an ever-evolving school project that passes from one development
                team to the next each semester within the Gameplay Engineering program at the HvA. The core objective is
                to create a fun and distinctive boomer-shooter that incorporates magical mechanics to elevate the combat
                experience. The real challenge, however, lies in the game engine: Unreal Engine 5. Although our projects
                are typically built in Unity, the client specifically requested Unreal for this assignment in order to
                leverage features like Lumen and Nanite.</p>
            <p class="description">The goal is to create a fun experience for players while also giving students the
                opportunity to explore new engines and expand their skills as game developers.</p>

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p class="description">My work on the project focused primarily on improving several visual aspects of the
                game, including the title screen and the in-game player HUD. Earlier iterations were functional but
                lacked a cohesive theme and felt out of place. I took it upon myself to redesign these elements so they
                fit the game’s style and helped create a more immersive player experience.</p>
            <p class="description">In addition to the visual overhaul, I implemented a keybinding system that allows
                players to customize their controls, making the game more accessible for everyone.</p>
            <p class="description">Finally, the project was missing a clear reason for players to keep playing. A
                concrete goal to strive for. To address this, I added a scoring system that tracks enemy kills, as well
                as a speedrunning feature that records completion time. Combined with highscores and fastest-time
                tracking, these mechanics encourage players to improve their scores and times with each run.</p>
